# ECG-Classification using ResNet

The human heart is a biological marvel where failure to function properly can lead to catastrophic consequences. Therefore, there is a great incentive for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of heart disease. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that measures the electrical signals of the heart. However, interpreting ECGs is a complex process that requires years of professional training and experience. This project makes use of a one-dimensional residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) to classify individual heartbeats using the PhysioNet MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. Our pre-processing pipeline makes use of the Pam-Tompkins algorithm to extract features and the SMOTE oversampling technique to over-sample the minority heartbeats. We make use of 5-fold cross-validation to determine the optimum regularization hyper-parameter and assess our model using accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity. An analysis of our model with these metrics reveals that it is competitive with other machine-learning techniques for ECG classification. However, there is room for improvement as our model still struggles to properly classify minority heartbeat classes in the database.
