# ECG-Classification

The human heart is a biological marvel where failure to function properly for even a moment can lead to catastrophic consequences. Therefore, there is great incentive to detect and diagnose heart disease as early as possible. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that measures the electrical signals of the heart, however, the interpretation of ECGs is a complex process which requires years of training for humans. This project aims to develop a deep learning model that can determine signs of pathology from ECG recordings. Contd..
